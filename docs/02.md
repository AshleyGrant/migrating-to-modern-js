# *var* to *const* and *let*

### Problems with *var* and implicit declaration

```
function foo(someInput) {
    function bar(barInput) {
       a = 'B';
       if(barInput > 10) {
         var a = 'C';
       }
    }

    if(someInput > 5) {
        a = 'A';

        bar(someInput)
    }
    
    return a + '!';
}
```

What is `a`? 
* foo(5);
* foo(6);
* foo(11);

What if I add in var in some places?

What is printed?
```
var x = y, y = 'A';
console.log(x);
```

* scoped to *current execution context*
  * global
  * within current function 
  * no scoping within, e.g., an *if* statement block
* `var` declarations are hoisted to the top of the execution context
* implicit declarations just leads to bugs

### *const* and *let*

* Variables are scoped in the way you expect them
* No more hoisting!
* This means variables are block-scoped.
* `const` doesn't allow reassignment, `let` does
