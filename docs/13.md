## nomodule

Older browsers have no idea what `<script type="module">` means, so they ignore it.

Newer browsers know how to load `type="module"`, and now they know to ignore `<script nomodule>`!

`<script nomodule src="...">` is the key to getting a native app that works in both new and old browsers!
