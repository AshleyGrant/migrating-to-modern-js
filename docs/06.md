## Modern Browsers Support ES2015 Modules Natively!

You don't need to bring your own module loader (Webpack, SystemJS, etc).

You just need to load your app using `<script type="module">`

You can then use `import` and `export` to your heart's content!

Do note you have to add `.js` to your `import` paths!
